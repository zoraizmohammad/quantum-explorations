    /// encoded into the amplitudes of each term in the superposition.

    /// For example: the first sample of the wave will be the amplitude of the
    /// |0> term, the second sample of the wave will be the amplitude of the
    /// |1> term, the third will be the amplitude of the |2> term, and so on.

    /// Your goal is to find the frequency of these samples, and return that
    /// frequency.

    /// # Input
    /// ## register
    /// The register which contains the samples of the sine wave in the
    /// amplitudes of  its terms.
    /// 
    /// ## sampleRate
    /// The number of samples per second that were used to collect the
    /// original samples. You will need this to retrieve the correct
    /// frequency.
    /// 
    /// # Output
    /// The frequency of the sine wave.
